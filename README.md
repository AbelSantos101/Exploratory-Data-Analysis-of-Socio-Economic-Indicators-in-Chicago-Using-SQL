# SQL-Exploratory-Data-Analysis-of-Socio-Economic-Indicators-in-Chicago

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook file and associated data for conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) of socio-economic indicators in Chicago using SQL queries. The project aims to analyze and visualize various socio-economic factors across different community areas in Chicago, including poverty rates, unemployment rates, educational attainment, and per capita income.

## Project Overview

The analysis is conducted using a dataset sourced from the Chicago City Portal, which includes socio-economic indicators for each Chicago community area for the years 2008 to 2012. The dataset comprises several variables, including:

 *   Community Area Number
 *   Community Area Name
 *   Percent of Housing Crowded
 *   Percent Households Below Poverty
 *   Percent Aged 16+ Unemployed
 *   Percent Aged 25+ without High School Diploma
 *   Percent Aged Under 18 or Over 64
 *   Per Capita Income
 *   Hardship Index

## Project Structure

*    socioeconomic_analysis.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook file containing SQL queries, data analysis, and visualization code.
*    socioeconomic.db: SQLite database file containing the Chicago socio-economic dataset.
*    README.md: This file, providing an overview of the project, its objectives, and instructions for usage.

## Key Findings

*    Analysis of socio-economic indicators reveals significant disparities across different community areas in Chicago.
*    There is a strong correlation between hardship index scores, per capita income, and the percentage of households below the poverty line.
*    Spatial analysis highlights clusters of high hardship index scores in the south and west sides of the city, indicating areas of concentrated socio-economic distress.
*    The analysis underscores the importance of targeted interventions to address economic disparities and promote social equity across Chicago.
